# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Recommendation System 

This is a movie recommendation system, built using machine learning techniques. Here I have used content based filtering.

## ðŸ“ƒ Project Overview 

This movie recommendation system leverages a dataset of movies to provide personalized recommendations.<br>
-> I have used it on TMDB Dataset as well as IMDB Dataset.

## ðŸ›« Features 
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user ratings and preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the features of the movie (such as genre, director, etc.).
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative and content-based methods for more accurate recommendations.
